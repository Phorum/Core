Phorum incompatibility changes:
-------------------------------

This document describes changes between Phorum versions, which might affect
backward compatibility for third party code that was written for Phorum.


Phorum 5.2 -> Phorum 5.3:
-------------------------

  Templates
  ---------

  * Renamed template files:

    index_classic.tpl         -> index_directory.tpl
    index_new.tpl             -> index_flat.tpl

  Modules
  -------

  * Announcement module has a new template:
    mods/announcements/templates/emerald/javascript.tpl
    If you have a custom announcements template, then create
    the javascript.tpl in your own template. Emerald uses it for
    Ajax based newflags handling. It is okay to make this an empty file
    for your template.

  Language strings
  ----------------

  * The following language strings were added:

    ActionPending
    ActionsPending

  Core code
  ---------

  * phorum_build_forum_list() from include/forum_functions.php has been
    deprecated in favor of phorum_api_forums_tree() from the forums API
    include/api/forums.php. The call is backward compatible and for now,
    we have a replacement forum_functions.php which still implements
    the phorum_build_forum_list() function. For new code, it is adviced
    to use phorum_api_forums_tree().

  * Configuration variable $PHORUM['use_new_folder_style'] was renamed to
    $PHORUM['index_style']. The old values were TRUE and FALSE. The new
    values to use are PHORUM_INDEX_DIRECTORY and PHORUM_INDEX_FLAT.

    Along with this change, the index scripts were renamed:
    include/index_classic.php -> include/index/directory.php
    include/index_new.php     -> include/index/flat.php

    And the related template files:
    index_classic.tpl         -> index_directory.tpl
    index_new.tpl             -> index_flat.tpl

    This change was done to get rid of the "new" and "classic" terminology,
    which doesn't tell new users of Phorum much. It also opens up options
    for implementing more index styles than "directory" and "flat" alone.

  * DOC TODO: the custom profile fields were transferred to custom fields,
    which can be added to users, forums and messages.

  * API file include/api/file_storage.php has been renamed to
    include/api/file.php.


  Database layer code
  -------------------

  * phorum_db_get_forums() previously skipped loading inactive forums and
    folders, unless PHORUM_ADMIN was defined. This function now has an
    extra argument $include_inactive, which can be used to tell specifically
    whether the inactive entries should be loaded or not.

    Some more new arguments were added to this db layer call, but those are
    backward compatible. To retrieve forums and folders from the database
    however, it is adviced to not use this db layer call anymore, but
    the API call phorum_api_forums_get() instead.

    This change was done for implementing the new Forums API code.

  * phorum_db_mod_banlists() now takes an extra argument to make it
    possible to store a comment with the ban items.

  * phorum_db_get_thread_list() and phorum_db_get_messages() do no longer
    produce different output based on $PHORUM['reverse_threading'].
    The new tree sorting code from include/api/tree.php can handle reverse
    threading on an ascending sorted message list.
