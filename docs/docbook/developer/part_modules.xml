      This section describes Phorum's module system. It is targeted at
      developers who want to do customization and extend the functionality
      of Phorum. Modules are the preferred way to archieve this.
    </para>
    <para>
      For much of this document, we will be talking about an example module
      "foo". Of course you will not name your module "foo", but something much
      more appropriate. If you're not familiar with the terms "foo" and "bar",
      you can visit <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasyntactic_variable">Wikipedia</ulink> to see why we chose them.

      Be sure to read at least the CAUTIONS AND SECURITY ISSUES section,
      before making your own modules.

      <para>
        Modules are self contained pieces of software, that can be added to
        Phorum to change or extend its functionality. Modules can do this
        without having to change anything in the standard Phorum distribution
        files or database structure.
      </para>
      <para>
        The big advantage of modules this is that upgrading the Phorum code
        is easy (no file changes to redo after upgrading) and that modules
        can be easily uninstalled when needed.
      </para>
      <para>
        Installing a module means: drop the code in the Phorum mods directory,
        go to the admin "Modules" page, enable the module and enjoy!
        One additional thing that might be needed, is editing one or
        more template files to display data that is generated by the module.

      <title>Hacks</title>
      <para>
        The moment it is neccessary to make changes to the standard Phorum
        distribution files or database structure to implement some kind of
        functionality, we are talking about a hack (even if the changes
        that have to be made are accompanied by a drop in module).
      </para>
      <para>
        Although there is nothing wrong with writing hacks, the Phorum team
        wants to urge you to try if you can write a module before resorting
        to a hack. Especially if you are going to publish your changes to
        the public. Modules are the preferred way of modifying Phorum
        functionality, because that will make both upgrading your distribution
        and having your modification adopted by others easier.

    <section id="modules.hooks">
      <title>Hooks</title>
      <para>
        The Phorum core and Phorum modules are interconnected through hooks.
        Hooks are points in the application where Phorum stops and runs
        its data through the modules that are configured to handle the
        hook. The modules can act upon and change this data.
      </para>
      <para>
        The following image visualizes what happens when Phorum reaches
        a hook point in the application, for which two modules ("foo" and
        "bar") have been configured.

    <section id="modules.hookfunctions">
      <title>Hook functions</title>
      <para>
        A module contains PHP functions that act as hook functions.
        Hook functions will receive some data from Phorum
        through their arguments and have to return the (possibly modified)
        data, which will then go either back to Phorum or to the input
        of another module which also handles the same hook
        (see <xref linkend="modules.hooks"/>).
        Based on this, the most basic (and useless) hook function you could
        write would look somewhat like this (see XXX for an explanation
        of the naming scheme that was used for the function):
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
function phorum_mod_foo_some_hook ($data) {
  return $data;
}]]></programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
        The exact nature of the data that is sent to the hook functions
        depends solely on the hook that is run. See <xref linkend="hooks"/>
        for a description of all supported hooks, including a specification
        of the type of data that is sent.

    <section id="module.writingyourownintro">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      This section will explain to you how to roll your own Phorum modules.
      We will start out by explaining some of the
      <xref linkend="modules.terminology" xrefstyle="template:terminology"/>
      that relates to modules. After that, we will explain a very important
      part modules: the <xref linkend="modules.moduleinfo"
      xrefstyle="template:module information"/>. This contains information
      for both Phorum (what hooks to run in what order, version dependancies)
      and module users (title, description and other interesting facts).
      From there on we will walk you through all the possibilities that
      modules have.
    </section>

    <section id="modules.moduleinfo">
      <title>Module information</title>
      <para>
        Module information is the glue between your module and Phorum.
        It provides information to Phorum about your module.
        Before we explain how to add this module information to your
        module, we will first explain what data can be put in there
        and how that data is formatted.
      </para>
      <para>
        Module information is formatted using lines of plain text. Each line
        contains a piece of information about the module. The general format
        for each of the lines in the module information is:
        <programlisting><![CDATA[ <key>: <value> ]]></programlisting>
        Empty lines are allowed between these key/value pairs.
        Below, you can find a list of the keys and values that can be
        used in the module information.

                <para>
                  The main difference between "run module" and "run hook"
                  is that "run module" will affect the priority for each
                  hook of the module and that "run hook" is used to
                  specifically change the priority of a single hook.
                  So to run all hooks for a module as early as possible,
                  but run the "foo" hook as late as possible and the
                  "bar" hook before the smileys mod, one could use the
                  following priority lines:

                  priority: run hook foo after *<sbr/>

        It is allowed to use multiple hook lines in your module information,
        so your module can act upon multiple hooks. When doing this, it
        is also allowed to use the same hook function for handling different
        hooks in your module (asuming the hooks are compatible).

        What this module info does, is telling Phorum that when it gets to
        "some_other_hook", it will have to call the function
        <literal>phorum_mod_foo_some_other_hook()</literal> in your module.
        It also tells that for "yet_another_hook" the same function has to
        be called. It will also take care that the hook "some_hook" is run
        before the same hook in the module "some_other_module".

            Single file modules are useful in case case no additional files
            have to be distributed with your module. Because the module
            consists of only one single file, it is very easy to distribute.
            Beware though that the moment that you want to support for
            example a settings screen, multiple languages or custom images,
            you will have to switch to the multiple file module structure.
            Switching does mean some extra work for your users. So only use
            this format for modules for which you are sure that you do not
            need additional files in the future.
          </para>
          <para>
            Single file modules consist of one single PHP file. The name
            of this file is not restricted. We advice you to use
            <filename>mod_&lt;module name&gt;.php</filename> though
            for clarity and consitency with other module
            (e.g. <filename>mod_foo.php</filename>).
            This file contains both the module information and the hook
            function definitions. For storing the module informaton, a
            special PHP comment is used. This comment must look like the

      <title>Supporting multiple languages</title>

      <para>
        This feature is supported by the <xref linkend="modules.multifile"
        xrefstyle="template:multiple file structure"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        If your module includes text that will be displayed to end users,
        you should strongly consider making it support multiple languages.
        This will allow Phorum installations that use a different language(s)
        to display output of your module in the same language(s),
        instead of the language you have written the module in.
      </para>
      <para>
        For supporting multiple languages, the first thing to do is add the
        following line to your module information file
        <filename>info.txt</filename>:

        <programlisting>hook: lang|</programlisting>

        There is no actual hook function configured here, because the
        "lang" hook is only used as a marker for Phorum. It tells Phorum
        that your module supports multiple languages.
      </para>
      <para>
        Next, you must provide at least one language file with your module.
        Language files are stored in a subdirectory name "lang" inside your
        module directory. In our sample module, the full directory would be
        <filename>{phorum dir}/mods/foo/lang/</filename>. The language files
        must be named identical to the main language files that Phorum uses.
        To include both English and French, your module would require the
        following file structure:
        <programlisting>
{phorum dir}/
     |
     +-- mods/
          |
          +-- foo/
               |
               +-- info.txt
               |
               +-- foo.php
               |
               +-- lang/
                    |
                    +-- english.php
                    |
                    +-- french.php </programlisting>

        The structure of your language files will be almost identical to
        that of the main Phorum language files. However, for your own
        language files it is advisable to add an extra level in the
        language variables, to avoid conflicts with language string from
        other modules or Phorum itself. Here is an example of how you
        could do that:

        <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?php
$PHORUM["DATA"]["LANG"]["mod_foo"] = array(
    "Hello"   => "Hello!",
    "Bye"     => "Good bye!"
);
?> ]]></programlisting>

        Here, the extra inserted level is <literal>["mod_foo"]</literal>.
        To access the "Hello" string from your module code you would
        use the PHP variable:
        <programlisting>
$PHORUM["DATA"]["LANG"]["mod_foo"]["Hello"]</programlisting>

        When you want to use the language string from a template file,
        the you would use the following <xref linkend="templates.templatevars"
        xrefstyle="template:template variable"/>:
        <programlisting>
{LANG->mod_foo->Hello}</programlisting>

      </para>
      <para>
        In case a Phorum installation is using a language that your module
        does not support, Phorum will automatically attempt to fallback to
        English. So it is highly recommend that you include an
        <filename>english.php</filename> language file in all your modules.
        If both the current language and English are not found, Phorum will
        be unable to load a language for your module and will display empty
        space instead of your language strings.
      </para>
      <para>
        Always try to reuse strings that are already in the main Phorum
        language files itself. Only create custom strings when there is
        no alternative available. Having more text to translate is more
        work for translators and using core language strings helps in
        keeping the used terminology consistent.

          Sometimes, modules will have to store some data in the Phorum
          system. For example an avatar module would have to store what
          avatar a user want to show and a poll module would have to add
          the question, answers and voting results for a poll to messages
          in which a poll is added.

          This section description what standard methods are available for
          letting modules store their data in the Phorum system. Of course,
          as a module writer, you can divert from this and use any kind
          of storage that you like. You are in no way limited to only use
          Phorum specific methods here.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section id="modules.storemessagedata">
        <title>Storing data for messages</title>

        <para>
          If your module needs to store data along with a Phorum message,
          the easiest way is to make use of the meta information array that
          is attached to each message array
          (<literal>$message["meta"]</literal>).
          This array is a regular PHP array, which is stored in the
          database as serialized data (see <ulink url="http://www.php.net/serialize">PHP's serialize manual</ulink>).
          Because Phorum and other modules make use of this meta data as
          well, you should never squash it, neither access the meta data
          in the database directly. Instead use the methods described in
          this section.
        </para>
        <para>
          To prevent name space collissions with other modules or Phorum,
          it is good practice to create only one key in the meta data
          array named <literal>mod_&lt;yourmodule&gt;</literal> (in our
          example: <literal>mod_foo</literal>). If your module needs to
          store only one single value, then put it directly under this key:
          <programlisting>
$message["meta"]["mod_foo"] = "the single value";</programlisting>
          If multiple values need to be stored, then put an array under
          the key. This array can be as complicated as you like:
          <programlisting><![CDATA[
$message["meta"]["mod_foo"] = array(
    "key1"    => "value1",
    "key2"    => "value2",
    "complex" => array(
        0 => "what",
        1 => "a",
        2 => "cool",
        3 => "module"
    )
); ]]></programlisting>
        </para>
        <para>
          <important>because the meta data is stored as serialized data in the
          database, it is not possible to handle the data you store in there
          through SQL queries.</important>
        </para>
        <para>
          When storing information in the meta data from a hook function, you
          can encounter two different situations, which both need a different
          way of handling: hooks that get an editable message array as their
          argument and hooks that don't.
        </para>

        <section id="modules.storemessagedata.type1">
          <title>
            From hooks that get an editable message array as their argument
          </title>
          <para>
            <remark>
              If you see ??? below at the places where you are supposed
              to see hook docs, then it is because the hook docs for
              "before_post" and "before_edit" have not yet been written.
            </remark>
            There are some hooks that send a full message structure to the
            hook functions. These can change the message structure before
            returning it to Phorum. Examples are the hooks
            "<xref linkend="hook.before_post"/>" and
            "<xref linkend="hook.before_edit"/>". For these kind of
            hooks, you can update the meta information in the message
            structure and be done with it. Here's an example of what this
            could look like in your hook function:
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
function phorum_mod_foo_before_post ($message)
{
    // Make sure that we have an array for mod_foo in the meta data.
    if (!isset($message["meta"]["mod_foo"]) ||
        !is_array($message["meta"]["mod_foo"])) {
        $message["meta"]["mod_foo"]["foodata"] = array();
    }

    // Add some fields to the mod_foo data.
    $message["meta"]["mod_foo"]["foodata"] = "Some data";
    $message["meta"]["mod_foo"]["bardata"] = "Some more data";

    // Return the updated message. Phorum will take care of
    // storing the "mod_foo" array in the database.
    return $message;
} ]]></programlisting>
          </para>
        </section> <!-- end of storing message data from message hooks -->

        <section id="modules.storemessagedata.type2">
          <title>From other hooks</title>
          <para>
            For other hooks, the proper way to store information in the meta
            data is to first retrieve the current message data (including the
            current meta data) using the phorum_db_get_message() function.
            After this, merge the information for your module with the
            existing meta data and store the updated data in the database
            using the phorum_db_update_message() function.
            Here is an example of what this could look like in your hook
            function:
            <programlisting><![CDATA[
function phorum_mod_foo_some_hook ($data)
{
    // Somehow you get the id for the message. Here we asume
    // that it is stored in the $data hook parameter.
    $message_id = $data["message_id"];

    // Retrieve the message from the database.
    $message = phorum_db_get_message ($message_id);

    // Extract the current meta data.
    $meta = $message['meta'];

    // Make sure that we have an array for mod_foo in the meta data.
    if (!isset($meta["mod_foo"]) || !is_array($meta["mod_foo"])) {
        $meta["mod_foo"]["foodata"] = array();
    }

    // Add some fields to the mod_foo data.
    $meta["mod_foo"]["foodata"] = "Some data";
    $meta["mod_foo"]["bardata"] = "Some more data";

    // Store the updated meta data in the database.
    phorum_db_update_message($message_id, array("meta" => $meta));

    // Return the data that we got as input for this hook function.
    return $data;
} ]]></programlisting>

           Changing meta data for a message this way will ensure that the
           existing meta data is kept intact.
