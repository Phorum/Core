      Why do you show the number of messages and not the number of replies
      for a topic on the list page?
    </title>
    <para>
      In short: the people writing the code liked it better. If you want
      to show the number of replies, you can modify your template by
      putting this line of code in your lists.tpl template file:
      <programlisting>
        &lt;?php $PHORUM['TMP']['MESSAGES']['thread_count']--; ?&gt;
      </programlisting>
      Put that line right after the line that says:
      <programlisting>
        {LOOP MESSAGES}
      </programlisting>

      Does Phorum have avatars or user rankings like (insert UBB clone)?
    </title>
    <para>
      Not by default. There are modules available to add this functionality.
      See the module list page for an overview of available modules:

      Why do unregistered users not have new message indicators?
    </title>
    <para>
      In Phorum 3, the data for the new message indicators was stored inside
      cookies. That way, both registered and unregistered users could see
      them. However, because of many cookie problems that plagued Phorum 3,
      we decided to store all user settings in the database for Phorum 5
      instead. The down side of this is that users must be registered to
      show new messages. The up side is that the new indicators really
      work like they should in Phorum 5: messages that are read stay read
      when switching browser or computer.

      What are sticky topics?
    </title>
    <para>
      Sticky topics (a.k.a. "stickies") are topics that stay at the top of
      the forum they are posted in and do not get bumped down as new topics
      are posted. Often, sticky topics are used to post a forum FAQ or
      forum rules, so new users will always find these at the start of the
      forum topic list.

      Can I post announcements?
    </title>
    <para>
      For announcements, create a forum in which you will post announcement
      messages. Setup the permissions in such way that only the users who
      are allowed to create new announcements can post to this forum.
    </para>
    <para>
      After this, go to the Modules page in the admin interface. There, you
      can enable the "Announcements" module and edit its settings to point
      it at the new announcement forum.

      How do I stop spammers from signing up and posting on my forum?
    </title>
    <para>
      From Phorum 5.2 onwards, the comprehensive Spam Hurdles module is
      included, which includes a number of spam prevention tools,
      including CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test
      to tell Computers and Humans Apart). For more information on
      this and other modules, have a look at the
      <ulink url="../admin/index.html">Administrator Manual</ulink>.
