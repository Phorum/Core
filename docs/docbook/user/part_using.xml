  <title>Create a Profile</title>
   <para>
   To post, reply and subscribe to topics, and to personalise user
   settings through the Control Panel, you have to create a user
   profile. The possible exception to this rule is if the forum
   administrator allows anonymous posting in certain forums, in which
   case you do not need to register to post topics or reply to them.
   However, in most cases at least the majority of forums require
   creating a user profile to perform these actions.

   address you enter - it is important this is correct for validating
   your account and other functions. Also, make sure your password is
   strong by using an alphanumeric combination of characters at least 8
   characters long.

   3. Once you have clicked the submit button, you will be informed as
   to whether you need to take any further action to active your
   account. On some forums you may need to click on a verification link
   which will be sent to the email address you provided, a moderator may
   need to approve your account, or both.

  <title>Creating topics, replying and editing posts</title>
   <para>
   A topics is the starting point of any conversation on a forum. An
   initial poster creates a subject and a post, and then other users
   can reply to it. In this way users can converse about specific
   'topics' of conversation.
   </para>
   <para>
   To create a topic, follow these steps:
   </para>
   <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">1.</emphasis> Browse to the forum you want to
   post a topic in, then click on the 'New Topic' link above the topic
   list.
   </para>
   <para>
   <emphasis role="bold">2.</emphasis> The posting interface will now be
   displayed. First, enter the subject of your topic, and then the message
   section. You can add smilies, formatting, links, pictures and more to
   your post by using the editor tools located above the message box, which
   is present on most Phorum installations. Hover over the buttons for a
   description of what they do, and for help with BBCode (Bulletin Board
   Code) and smilies, click on the ? button on the right.

   You can also choose to add your signature to the post, and to
   follow the topic. Additionally, you may post attachments by
   clicking on 'Attach a file...'. When you are finished, you can click
   on 'Preview' to look at your post before submitting it, or post it by
   clicking 'Post message'.
   </para>
   <para>
   To reply to topics, browse to the topic you want to reply to then
   click on the Reply link below a post, or fill out the posting form at
   the bottom of the topic. Then follow the same procedure described
   above.
   </para>
   <para>
   You can also edit your posts after submitting them by clicking on the
   'Edit' link beneath your post. The administrator can set a specific
   time limit within which you can edit your post.
   <important>
   Some of the actions you can perform are limited by administrative
   settings. For example, an administrator can prevent users from
   starting new topics, replying to them, editing posts, adding
   attachments and following topics within specific forums.
