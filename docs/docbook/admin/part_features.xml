   <title>General Settings</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold"> Phorum Title:</emphasis>
     Enter the title of your forum here. This will be displayed on
     the index page of your forum.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold"> Phorum Description:</emphasis> A description of
     your forum. This will be displayed on the index page of your forum.
     This is also useful from a Search Engine Optimization perspective.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">DNS Lookups:</emphasis>
     If enabled, this instructs forum to perform a DNS lookup on certain
     items, such as:
     <itemizedlist>
       <listitem><para>
         logging the hostname from which a message was posted, instead
         of the plain IP address;
       </para></listitem>
       <listitem><para>
         being able to create IP ban items based on host and domain names;
       </para></listitem>
       <listitem><para>
         checking the email address that is for user registrations.
       </para></listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     Generally this is a useful function for an administrator, and should
     be left enabled. However, if Phorum keeps reporting illegal email
     addresses during signup or if you are suffering from massive delays
     during posting messages, then there might be DNS problems on your
     server. In that case, disable DNS lookups as a work around.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Hide Forums:</emphasis>
     If this is enabled, forums which a user does
     not have the permissions to read will be hidden from them.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold"> Show New Count in Forum List:</emphasis>
     This feature will show registered users how many new messages and
     threads there are in each forum on the forum list page. If you have
     a large number of posts, a large number of forums, a large number
     of users or some combination of the three, this setting could cause
     some performance issues. If you see performance issues, try setting
     it "No count, indicator only" or "No"
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Folder/Forum Display Style:</emphasis>
     Since version 3, Phorum has included folders.
     Until version 5.1, forums inside folders did not show until you
     clicked on the folder. In 5.1, the list of forums in a folder can
     now be shown under that folder in the forum list. This allows admins
     to organize a large list of forums all on one page.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Enable Moderator Notifications:</emphasis>
     By setting this to Yes, Phorum will display a notice to the various
     kinds of moderators when they have a new item that requires their
     attention. For example, if this setting is enabled, moderators
     will see a notice whenever there is an unapproved message.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">User Post Edit Time Limit:</emphasis>
     If set to a value larger then 0, this acts as a time limit for post
     editing. Users will only be able to edit their own posts within
     this time limit. This only applies if a user has the necessary
     permissions to edit their post, and does not affect moderators.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Track Edit Changes:</emphasis>
     When enabled, the changes made to a message will be stored
     and viewed by users. It can optionaly only be viewed by moderators.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Reply form appears:</emphasis>
     This setting specifies where the reply form for threads is
     displayed, either on the read page or on a separate page.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">After posting go to:</emphasis>
     This setting specifies where the user is redirected after
     posting, either to the message read page or the message list.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">After submitting a search query:</emphasis>
     On large forums or slow servers, searching for messages might take a
     little while. To prevent users from submitting the same search
     query over and over again (in case they think the search didn't work,
     because they didn't get their results fast enough), you can show an
     intermediate page, telling the user that the search is running.
     If your system can deliver search results quickly enough, then you can
     skip the intermediate page and go directly to the search results page.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Database error handling:</emphasis>
     This setting determines how Phorum handles database errors. The default
     is to show the errors on screen. "Errors will go to a logfile" is useful
     if you don't want your users to see the errors, and "Errors will be
     emailed" is useful if you want immediate notification of any database
     errors on your forums.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Secret private key for signing data:</emphasis>
     On several occasions, data is transferred from the Phorum system to
     the user's system and back again. To be sure that there was no
     tampering with this data on the way, it is signed by Phorum using
     this secret key. If you do not understand what this is for, then
     it is safe to simply keep the pre-configured value.
     <sbr />
     <important>
       If you change this key, users who are active right now might
       experience problems.
     </important>
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Allow Linking to Uploaded Files:</emphasis>
     You may not want to allow other web sites to link to files that users
     have uploaded to your forums. If not, then set this option to
     "Only from the forum". If you want to use links on other parts
     of your web site, then use "From this web site". If you want to
     allow other websites to link to your forum file uploads, then select
     "From any web site".
   </para>
   <para>
     If your needs are more specific than this (e.g. if you want to allow
     access from a specific group of web sites), you will need to use your
     web server's security features to accomplish this. Apache users can
     reference Prevent "Image Theft" at
     <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/env.html#examples">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/env.html#examples</ulink>.
     Users of the cPanel system can also configure this through the
     "Hotlink Protection" feature.
   </para>
   <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Put file name in pathinfo for file download URLs:</emphasis>
     All Phorum file downloads (for user files and forum message attachments)
     run through the file.php script. As a result, users who right-click a
     file URL and choose "Save link as .." will end up in their browser with
     file.php as the default file name. With this option enabled however,
     Phorum will try to give the browser a real file name instead. This is
     done by putting the file name in the URL as pathinfo (which makes the
     download link look like
     <filename>/file.php/downloadfile.ext?1,2,file=3</filename>).
   </para>
   <para>
     The webserver needs to support the use of pathinfo for this feature to
     work. So if you are unable to download files after enabling this option,
     your webserver probably lacks pathinfo support and you cannot use
     this feature.
   </para>

      <para>
       <emphasis role="bold">Phorum HTML Title:</emphasis>
       This can be used to set the title of your Phorum. Equivalent to
       changing the HTML title tag.
     </para>
     <para>
       <emphasis role="bold">Phorum Head Tags:</emphasis>
       This option can be used to provide additional HTML code that will
       be added to the head section of the pages. This could for example
       be used for adding meta keywords.
     </para>
     <para>
       <emphasis role="bold">Show and allow feed links:</emphasis>
       A feed is a standardized format for providing information about
       new content on a web site. Various programs can be used to process
       and read feed information (e.g. specialized "feed readers",
       Firefox, Google's on line feed reader, Thunderbird mail). If you
       enable this feature, then your visitors will be able to subscribe to
       feeds for your forums.
     </para>
     <para>
       Note that feed readers will automatically poll for feed updates using
       a client side defined time interval, so with a lot of active feed
       subscriptions, the number of requests to your web server will rise.
       Phorum uses server side caching of the feed data to keep the server
       load that is required for supporting feeds to a minimum.
     </para>
     <para>
       <emphasis role="bold">Default feed type:</emphasis>
       There are multiple standards for providing content feeds. Phorum
       supports RSS and ATOM, which are the most widely spread XML based
       feed formats.
       <sbr />
       If you are unsure what to use, then select "RSS".
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">HTTP Path:</emphasis> This is the base URL of your Phorum.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Disabled URL:</emphasis> This url will be redirected to
       when the Phorum status is disabled. If no URL is given, a message in English
       will be displayed.
      </para>
      <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Time Zone Offset:</emphasis> If you and/or your users are
      in a different timezone than the server, you can have the default displayed time
      adjusted by using this option.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Use Cookies:</emphasis> Phorum can track logged in users by
     using cookies or session information on URLs.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Use No Cookies:</emphasis> The session information will
     always be included on the URL.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Allow Cookies:</emphasis> The session information will be
     stored in cookies, if the user's browser supports it. Otherwise, the information
     is included in the URL.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Require Cookies:</emphasis> Session information is only
     stored in cookies. If the user's browser does not support cookies, the user will
     not be able to log in.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Main Session Timeout (days):</emphasis> When users log in
     to your Phorum, they are issued a cookie. You can set the timeout value to a
     number of days that you want the cookies to stay on the users computer. If you
     set it to 0, the cookie will only last as long as the user has the browser open.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Session Path (start with /):</emphasis>: When cookies are
     sent to the client's browser, part of the cookies determines the path (URL) for
     which the cookies are valid. For example, if the URL is http://example.com/phorum,
     you could set the path to /phorum. Then, the user's browser would only send the
     cookie information when the user accessed the Phorum. You could also simply / and
     the cookie info will be sent for any page on your site. This could be useful if
     you want to use Phorum's login system for other parts of your site.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Session Domain:</emphasis> Usually you can leave this blank.
     If you know you need to use a different domain (like if you use forums.example.com,
     you may want to just use example.com as the domain) you may enter it here.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Track User Usage:</emphasis> When set, the last time a user
     accessed the Phorum will be recorded as often as you have decided upon. This will
     require constant updates to your database. If you have a busy forum on weak
     equipment, it may be ill advised to use a short update interval.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Enable Tighter Security:</emphasis> Tight security in
     Phorum will require that users confirm their login information from time to time
     before posting messages, accessing private messages or using their Control Center.
     The length of time is determined by Short Session Timeout.
     </para>
     <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Short Session Timeout:</emphasis> When tight security is
     enabled, the users will be issued a second cookie when they type in their login
     information. If the user does not use the site for the period of time you set here,
     they will have to re-enter their login information before posting messages,
     accessing private messages or using their Control Center. They will still be allowed
     to read the Phorum as long as their Main Session is still good. The time is in
     minutes. The minimum is 5 minutes; otherwise, your users will be very angry at
     you.
     <sbr />
     P.S. 1 day = 1440 minutes
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Allow Time Zone Selection:</emphasis> If enabled, this will
     allow users to change the timezone of the forum (specific to their account).
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Allow Template Selection:</emphasis> If enabled, users will
     find an option in their Control Center to select the template to use.
       <sbr />
     Note: The user selected template will only be used for forums, which do not have
     "Fixed Display Settings" enabled in the forum settings.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Registration Verification:</emphasis> This allows you to
     force users to follow a verification process after registration. You can have
     them verify either:
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem><para>
     by email - a link is sent to the user's email address, which they have to click
     on to activate their account)
       </para></listitem>
       <listitem><para>
     by moderator - a moderator must approve the user before their account is activated
       </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
     Or both. This is a useful function to prevent spam, but keep in mind it adds extra
     hurdles for users trying to register, which could put certain people off.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Enable Drop-down user list:</emphasis> By setting this to
      Yes, Phorum will display a drop-down list of users instead of an empty text
      box on pages where you can select a user. Two examples of such pages are when
      sending a private message, and when adding users to a group in the grou
      moderation page. This option should be disabled if you have a large number of
      users, as a list of thousands of users will slow performance dramatically.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">What to use as the display name:</emphasis> You can choose
      to use either the user's username of the real name (which can be edited by the
      user from the Control Center) as the name which the user is referenced to
      throughout all Phorum pages.
       <important>
       This is not an option that you normally would want to change on a live
       system that has been running for a while. One reason is that all stored names
       will have to be updated in the database (e.g. the posting authors), which can
       take quite a while on a big forum (it will work though). More important is that
       you might confuse your users by changing their display names.
       </important>
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Hide Email Addresses:</emphasis> You can choose to set
      whether all email addresses should be hidden. This includes the email
      addresses of anonymous users and registered users in their profile. The separate
      option to hide the email address in the user Control Center will be hidden too.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">File Uploads:</emphasis> These settings apply to personal
      file uploads that users can do in their Control Center. The users can link to
      these files by copying and pasting the file URLs. Some modules (like the avatar
      module) also make user of personal files (for example, for storing images that
      the user can use as the avatar to show). Keep in mind that upload file size is
      also restricted by the upload size limit of php.ini.
        <sbr />
      These settings do not control uploading of forum message attachments. For
      changing message attachment settings, you have to edit the settings of the forum
      for which you want to enable attachments.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Private Messaging (PM):</emphasis>: If enabled, this will
      allow users to access/use the private messaging system.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Check for new PM:</emphasis> By settings this to Yes,
      Phorum will check if a user has new private messages, and display an indicator.
      On a Phorum with a lot of users and private messages, this may hurt
      performance. This option has no effect if Private Messaging is disabled.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Maximum number of stored messages:</emphasis> This is the
      maximum number of private messages that a user may store on the server. The
      numbr of private messages is the total of all messages in all PM folders combined.
      Setting this value to 0 will allow for unlimited messages.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Allow notification of PM by email:</emphasis> If this option
     is enabled, Phorum will send a notification email to users that receive a new
     private message. The user will find an option in their Control Center which can be
     used to disable the notification email.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">System Emails from Name:</emphasis> This allows you to
      specify what name system emails are signed by.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">System Emails from Address:</emphasis> Specify which email
      address system emails are sent from.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Use Bcc in emails:</emphasis> This prevents recipients seeing
      the complete list of recipient addresses. If this is disabled, the system will
      use CC (carbon copy), so each recipient can see all recipient email addresses.
     </para>
     <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Ignore admin for moderator emails:</emphasis> If you select
      Yes for this option, then the moderator notifications and report message emails
      will not be sent to the administrator, only to moderators.
     </para>

 </section>
 <section id="features.settings.cache">
    <title>Cache Settings</title>
    <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Cache Directory:</emphasis>
    Caching is used to take some load off the database and web server. The cache directory
    is used for caching preprocessed Phorum templates and for caching data in case "file
    system based" is selected as the cache layer below.
    </para>
    <para>
    For most installations, it will be fine to set it to the default temp directory for the server
    (/tmp on UNIX systems and C:\Windows\Temp for Windows system).
    </para>
    <para>
    If your server has PHP Safe Mode enabled, you will need to create a directory under your
    Phorum directory and make it writable by the web server (you can use the directory "./cache"
    which was included in the Phorum distribution for this purpose). Additionally, if you are
    running Phorum on a shared server, it is generally advantageous to use the "./cache" directory
    instead of "/tmp".
    </para>
    <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Enable Caching stylesheet data (CSS):</emphasis>
    Phorum uses a system where modules can add data to the main stylesheet for the pages.
    By enabling this feature, Phorum can cache the dynamically generated data and improve
    caching of the stylesheet data in the browsers of your visitors. Enabling this
    feature is highly recommended. Only disable it if you are having problems with it.
    </para>
    <para>
    <emphasis role="bold">Enable Caching JavaScript code:</emphasis>
    Phorum uses a system where modules can provide JavaScript code for the pages. By enabling
    this feature, Phorum can cache the dynamically generated data and improve caching of the
    JavaScript data in the browsers of your visitors. Enabling this feature is highly recommended.
    Only disable it if you are having problems with it.
    </para>
    <para>

    </para>
   </section>

   <section id="feautures.settings.banlists">
    <title>Ban Lists</title>
     <para>
     Ban items can be used to deny new user registrations and posting of (private) messages, based on
     various criteria. If a ban item applies to a user action, then this action will be fully blocked by
     Phorum. This can for example be used to block user registrations and postings from certain IP addresses
     or to prevent certain words from being used in forum messages.
     </para>
     <para>
     If you want to fully ban a user, then it's best to set "Active" to "No" for the user in the "Edit Users"
     interface.

      <para>
        Virtual Roots allow you to run "a phorum inside a
        phorum". It makes the selected folder to the "root
        folder" of all forums and folders below it which means
        that the "forum-list" links go as far up as to this
        folder and searches for "all forums" are limited to
        forums in this virtual root. The announcement-module has
        also functions to use a different forum per virtual root
        for the announcements. On the other hand, the
        administration-page is about all the forums/folders and
        users are valid about all forums (in all virtual roots)

    <section id="features.modules.intro">
      <title>What are Phorum Modules?</title>
      <para>
        Modules are (often) small extensions to
        Phorum-functionality without sacrificing performance of
        the Phorum-core. You can install them if needed for
        using their functionalities.
        <sbr />
        Take a look at the &listofmodules;

      <title>How do I install a module?</title>
      <para>
        All modules are installed inside the subdirectory "mods"
        of your Phorum installation directory. There are two
        types of modules: single file and multi file modules.
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            Single file modules
            <para>
              Single file modules consist of a single
              php-file containing also the description and
              hook-names. These kind of modules can't have
              a settings-page.
              <sbr />
              You install a single file module by simply
              dropping its php-file into the mods
              directory and enabling it in the
              administration pages.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            Multi file modules
            <para>
              Multi file modules consist of at least a
              directory with a php-file named the same as
              the directory and an info.txt-file.
              Additionally for a settings-page there needs

              <sbr />
              You install a multi-file module by copying
              the whole directory (preserving its
              directory structure) into the mods-directory
              and enabling it in the admin.

            Announcements are important messages shown to
            all users and on all (or specified) pages which
            should stand out over the regular posts.
            <sbr />
            Since Phorum-5.2 announcements are handled as a
            module which is distributed with Phorum. See
            <xref linkend="features.modules" />
            for generic module instructions. The module
            allows for better separation of posts and
            announcements and also some additional features
            like hiding announcements after a given time and
            it opens the way for other future announcements
            modules which offer even more functionalities.

            BBCode (Bulletin Board Code) is a system of tags
            which allows users to add markup to messages
            (bold, italic, images, links etc) in a safe way.
            For example, if text in a post was enclosed like
            so: [i]text[/i], it would be rendered in
            italics, [b]text[/b] would be rendered in bold,
            and so on.
