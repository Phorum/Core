This is a start of first UnitTests for Phorum.
Actually they are more a test on itself with some functions
to see and check the output.

/*
 * Prerequisites:
 * install PHPUnit >= 3.1.x
 * install PHP >= 5.2.x
 * install Phorum >= 5.2.x as usual with going through full installation
 * (optional) install xdebug extension for php (for codecoverage report)
 * (optional) install graphviz (for codecoverage report)
 *
 * run with:
 * phpunit PhorumTestSuite
 *
 * or for html/coverage reports:
 * phpunit --report ./report PhorumTestSuite
 * (this needs graphviz and xdebug installed!)
 * (report is put into report-directory in the phorum-directory then!)
 *
