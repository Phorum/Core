 * this script is meant to be run from the command-line
 * it extracts the CSS-data from the templates and will write it to a static file
 * keep in mind that you'll have to run it by hand if your color-settings change!!!
 *
 * for using that script you have either to use the chdir call or put it in the phorum-dir
 * keep in mind that others could use this script to overwrite files on your webserver
 * therefore there is the first exit(); in there, you have to remove it to use the script too
 *
 * to have Phorum use the static CSS, you'll have to edit header.tpl, instead the include of the css
 * you have to use a link href ...
