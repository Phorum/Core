Module  : Username Restrictions
Version : 1.0.2
Author  : Maurice Makaay

This module implements configurable features for enforcing user name
restrictions. The module will check the user name at registration time
and show an error to the user if the new username does not meet the
restrictions.

Implemented features are:

* Minimum username length;
* Maximum username length;
* Configuration of valid characters for usernames;
* Only allow lower case characters for usernames. 

This module requires Phorum 5.1 or later.


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive;

- Move the directory "username_restrictions" to the directory "mods"
  within your Phorum installation;

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "Username Restrictions". 

- Edit the settings for the module to setup the restrictions that
  you want to use for your Phorum installation. 


Customization:
--------------

You can translate the error messages that this module produces by writing a
language file "mods/username_restrictions/lang/<yourlang>.php".
In this filename <yourlang> has to be the same name as the main language
file that you use (i.e. "include/lang/<yourlang>.php"). If you write a
translation for this module, then please post it in the module's thread
at phorum.org, so I can include it in the distribution.

If you want to inform your users about username restrictions before they
submit the registration form, then you can edit the register.tpl template
file to include the information. Personally, I do not like cluttering the
registration form with extra info about username restrictions, because the
module will show a clear and detailed error message in case a user chooses
an illegal username and most users will probably choose a valid username
at their first try anyway.
