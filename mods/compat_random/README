Module  : Compatibility: Random Extension
Version : 1.0.0
Author  : Phorum Dev Team

This module implements a PHP 5.x fallback for random_bytes and random_int
functions.

Thanks to Paragon Initiative Enterprises for the implementation of his
Random_* Compatibility Library. See: https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat

Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive and move the directory "compat_random" to the
  directory "mods" within your Phorum installation (unless this module
  was packaged with your Phorum release);

- There is no need to enable the module manually. If your system needs
  it, Phorum will automatically load the module.
