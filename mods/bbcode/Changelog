Changelog:
----------

2010-11-06 v2.0.11

   - added option to add the nofollow attribute only to external URLs

2010-02-12 v2.0.10

   - added left/right alignment tags
   
2008-10-06 v2.0.9

   - Fixed #806: possible XSS leak plugged. This was reported as a
     security vulnerability, however we were never able to produce
     anything more than broken HTML code. Since broken HTML code is
     not good and because we are rather safe than sorry, this fix
     was implemented.

2008-09-01 v2.0.8

   - Fixed #787: BBcode module: end of message end tags for some
     bbcode tags were not processed correctly. The tag and the text
     that came before the tag were duplicated at the end of the
     rendered message.

   - Fixed #795: BBcode module needs to explicitly include api.php
     to define the constants that are used in the settings page.

   - Fixed #796: Undefined index "mod_bbcode_tags" in BBcode module.

   - Fixed #797: Undefined offset: 0 in api.php in case the message
     started with a stale BBcode close tag.

     Thanks to Alexey Torkhov for the heads up on these last three
     module issues.

2008-07-01 v2.0.7

   - Fixed a compatibility problem for PHP versions prior to 5.1.0.
     The PHP function htmlspecialchars_decode() is not available for
     those versions of PHP. Thanks to Adam for noticing!

   - Fixed a few cases of undefined index warnings. Thanks to Oliver
     Riesen for noticing!

2008-06-03 v2.0.6

   - Fixed a bug in handling stale close tags that directly follow
     another open or close tag. Thanks to CBiLL for the problem report.

2008-05-27 v2.0.5

   - Improved handling of stale close tags in the text and fixed
     a PHP undefined index warning along with it. Thanks to
     CBiLL for the problem report.

2008-05-15 v2.0.4

   - Made the tag and argument name parsing case insensitive, to match
     the old BBcode module behavior.

   - Fixed a little JavaScript problem. I was using the reserved word
     'char' as a variable name, which is bad practice and got rejected
     by Yahoo's Javascript YUI Compressor.

2008-05-08 v2.0.3

   - Fixes for making upgrades and fresh installations work smoother
     (without having to save the module settings before things start
     to work).

2008-04-16 v2.0.2

   - A help text for [list] was added to the BBcode help page.
     Translations will be needed for the available languages.
     For now, the english help was added to all help files for all
     languages.

   - Added back the templates directory which holds the template for
     the "disable BBcode" option in the posting editor.

2008-04-16 v2.0.1

   - Implemented a new tag configuration option BBCODE_INFO_STRIPBREAK.
     If eneabled for a tag, a <phorum break> that comes after the close
     tag is stripped. This is useful for tags that translate to an HTML
     tag that does not need the additional break for spacing.
     This option is enabled for the [list] bbcode tag.

   - Fixed turning bare URLs and email addresses into clickable links.

2008-04-15 v2.0.0

   - Rewrite for implementing a new tokenizer that allows for more advanced
     bbcode features. The new tokenizer also allows for automatic fixing of
     broken BBcode formatting (wrongly nested tags or tags that are not closed.
     It also allows for quoted tag arguments, which makes tags like
     [quote="[SomeClan] Gam3r \"666\" d00d"] possible.

   - The [email] tag now supports a new tag argument "subject". The editor
     tool button asks for the subject to use. This needs a new language
     string "enter subject" in the module's language file. If you have a
     language string for this, please let me know so I can include it in
     the module package.

   - A new tag [list] is implemented. For this tag, some new language
     strings are required. These are "list", "enter new list item" and
     all the list descriptions that are formatted as "list type X".
     If you have language strings for these, please let me know so I can
     include them in the module package.

   - The [img] tag now supports a "size" argument, to change the displaying
     size of the image (in pixels). For example [img size="50x50"]...[/img]
     or [img size="50"]...[/img].
