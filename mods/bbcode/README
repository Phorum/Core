Module  : BBcode
Version : 2.0.12
Author  : Phorum Dev Team

This module allows users to add BBcode (Bulletin Board Code) tags to their
postings. BBcode tags are a safe way of adding markup (bold, italic, images,
links, etc.).


Install:
--------

- Unpack the archive and move the directory "bbcode" to the directory
  "mods" within your Phorum installation (unless this module was packaged
  with your Phorum release);

- Login as administrator in Phorum's administrative interface and
  go to the "Modules" section;

- Enable the module "BBcode".

- Go to the settings screen for the module to configure the features
  that you require.


Language support:
-----------------

This module supports multiple languages. If you want to translate the module
to a new language, you'll have to do the following:

1) copy lang/english.php to lang/yourlang.php (yourlang.php must have the
   same name as Phorum's main language file that you use).
   After this, translate the strings in lang/yourlang.php.

2) Copy the directory help/english to help/yourlang. After that, translate
   the text in the files within that directory.

If you have created a translation for this module, please post a zip file
containing lang/yourlang.php and help/yourlang in the modules forum
at http://www.phorum.org/phorum5, so we can add the translation to the
distribution.
