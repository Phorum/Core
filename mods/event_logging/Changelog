Changelog:
----------

2009-08-01 v1.0.7

    - Added a new logged event: User sends a private message.
      The fact that a PM was sent and the number of recipients are logged.

2009-07-27 v1.0.6

    - Fixed bug #865: Don't log errors if the silence operator @ is used.
      Thanks to Markus for both the bug report and the patch that fixes
      the issue.

    - Fixed bug #862: the event logs could not be downloaded if the
      maximum number of stored log lines was set to 0 ("no limit").
      Thanks to Markus Fischer for the bug report.

    - Added a new logged event: User requests a new password.
      Thanks to CBiLL for the idea. This feature requires a new hook
      that is only available in Phorum 5.2.13 and up.

    - Passwords that are logged in log messages are now masked with "XXXX".
      If an admin wants to have the passwords logged to the database
      (not recommended for security reasons), then the module configuration
      option "Hide passwords in log messages" can be disabled.

    - Modified the failed login event: if the username that was used is
      known to Phorum, then the user_id is set for the event. This way,
      failed login events can be filtered by the username as long as an
      existing username was used. Thanks to CBiLL for the idea.

    - Fixed a bug: with event logging programmatically suspended,
      not all hooks returned the correct data. This feature is not
      widely used (if at all), so there is no real user impact.

2009-05-19 v1.0.5

    - An option was added to download the event logs as HTML or TXT.
      Thanks to Joe Curia (a.k.a. Azumandias) for providing us with
      the patch for this feature.

    - Implemented automatic cleanup of old event logs. Previously,
      the event log was only cleaned up when the admin opened the
      log viewer in the admin interface. Because admins sometimes
      enable the module and don't look at it for a long while, the
      log table can grow pretty large.

      This could have some user impact, because cleaning up the
      logs has to be done within a user's page load. Under normal
      circumstances however, the user should not be aware of any
      delay due to this change. If admins do experience issues with
      this change, then please let us know. We will then extend the
      automatic cleanup (e.g. by only doing automatic cleanups in
      the page load of an administrator or moderator user).

2008-03-08 v1.0.4

    - Made the JOIN queries work in all MySQL server versions by fully
      qualifying the fields that are used in the queries.

2007-08-17 v1.0.3

    - Made the module settings screen behave in case the module is
      not activated.

2007-07-25 v1.0.2

    - Added an option to ignore logging of PHP notices for the admin
      interface. Because the whole admin interface was deliberately
      programming with disabled warnings, a lot of notices are
      triggered from that code. Those cluttered the event log too much.

2007-05-02 v1.0.1

    - Updated for 5.2 compatibility. The module now uses the new database
      layer API that was introduced for Phorum 5.2.

2007-04-21 v1.0.0

    - Initial release.
