Changelog:
----------

2007-08-17 v1.0.3

    - Made the module settings screen behave in case the module is
      not activated.

2007-07-25 v1.0.2

    - Added an option to ignore logging of PHP notices for the admin
      interface. Because the whole admin interface was deliberately
      programming with disabled warnings, a lot of notices are
      triggered from that code. Those cluttered the event log too much.

2007-05-02 v1.0.1

    - Updated for 5.2 compatibility. The module now uses the new database
      layer API that was introduced for Phorum 5.2.

2007-04-21 v1.0.0

    - Initial release.
